Code Documentation: Healthcare Translation App


**Overview**
The Voice Translation App is a Next.js application deployed on Vercel that allows users to translate text between different languages, with integrated speech recognition and speech synthesis capabilities. The application leverages the DeepL API for high-quality translations and modern web APIs for voice functionality.

**Code Structure**
Core Components
Main Application (`app/page.tsx`)
The core of the application is a React functional component that manages:
Speech recognition via custom hook
Speech synthesis via custom hook
Text translation via API
UI state management
User interaction handling
Translation API (`app/api/translate/route.ts`)
Server-side API route that interfaces with the DeepL translation service:
Validates incoming requests
Securely handles API key access
Processes translation requests
Handles error cases and responses
Layout & Styling
 Root layout (`app/layout.tsx`): Sets up the application shell, including fonts, theme provider, and toast notifications
Global styles (`app/globals.css`): Tailwind CSS configuration with custom theme variables for light/dark mode

**Key Custom Hooks** (Referenced but not included in provided files)
`useSpeechRecognition`: Manages browser's Speech Recognition API
   Handles recording state
   Processes speech-to-text conversion
   Handles language configuration
   Provides error handling
`useSpeechSynthesis`: Manages browser's Speech Synthesis API
  Controls text-to-speech playback
  Handles different language voices
  Provides event callbacks for speech events
  Implements error handling

**Libraries & Utilities** (Referenced but not included in provided files)
`lib/translation.ts`: 
    Provides the `translateText()` function to interface with the backend API
`lib/languages.ts`:
    Defines supported languages
    Maps language codes between different systems (DeepL, Web Speech API)
    Provides utility functions like `getSpeechCodeFromLanguageCode()`
UI Components:
    Uses shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Select, Textarea)
    Lucide React for icons
    Custom toast notifications via `useToast` hook

**AI Tools Implementation**
Speech Recognition
   Implemented via the Web Speech API through a custom React hook
Features:
   Real-time transcription of spoken words
   Language selection for source text
   Error handling and user feedback
   Recording state management
**Machine Translation**
   Powered by DeepL API through a secure server-side implementation
**Features:**
  High-quality text translation
  Support for multiple language pairs
  Secure API key handling
  Error handling and response parsing
**Speech Synthesis**
  Implemented via the Web Speech API through a custom React hook
  Features:
    Text-to-speech output for translated content
    Language-appropriate voice selection
    Playback control
    Error handling and event callbacks

**Security Considerations**
**API Key Protection**
DeepL API key is securely stored as an environment variable
Key is never exposed to the client side
Server-side API route handles all authenticated requests
**Input Validation**
Validation of required parameters on both client and server sides
Error handling for missing or invalid inputs
Proper error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
**Error Handling**
Comprehensive error handling throughout the application
User-friendly error messages via toast notifications
Logging of errors for debugging purposes
Graceful fallbacks for API or service failures
**Frontend Security**
Protected against common vulnerabilities through Next.js security features
No client-side exposure of sensitive data
Type safety through TypeScript implementation

**Performance Considerations**
**State Management**
Efficient use of React hooks for state management
Callback memoization with useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
**API Optimization**
Server-side API routes to minimize client-side processing
Error caching to prevent duplicate error notifications
**UI Responsiveness**
Loading states during API calls
Disabled buttons during processing to prevent duplicate actions
Mobile-friendly design with responsive layout

**Deployment Notes**
Built for deployment on Vercel
Requires environment variables:
`DEEPL_API_KEY`: For authentication with the DeepL translation service

**Dependencies**
Next.js (App Router)
React
Tailwind CSS
shadcn/ui components
Lucide React (icons)
DeepL API (external service)
Web Speech API (browser native)

**HTTPS Only**
Application requires HTTPS for security and for the Web Speech API to function
Automatically enforced by Vercel deployment
